    <h2>About Tulips</h2>
    <p>
        A great flower for early spring time, tulips are a welcoming sight against the bleakness
        at the end of winter. Tulips are cold-resistant, which helps them grow in areas with
        rocky seasonal transitions where temperatures fluctuate a great deal.
    </p>
    <h2>Caring for Tulips</h2>
    <p>
        Tulips don't like the heat but prefer full sun. In warmer regions, try planting in areas
        with partial shade. Tulips should be planted in well-draining, dry soil- they do not like
        too much moisture. Water tulips weekly, unless it rains during that week. Wilted flowers
        should be removed to promote additional growths, but do not remove the leaves.
    </p>
    <h2>Planting Tulips</h2>
    <p>
        Tulips should be planted about eight inches deep and three or four inches apart from one
        another. Plant in the fall, about a month and a half before the first frost is expected.
        If the ideal planting time is missed, plant them anyway- bulbs aren't meant to last above
        the surface.
