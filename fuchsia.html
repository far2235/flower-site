            <h2>About Fuchsias</h2>
            <p>
                Fuchsias are great at attracting hummingbirds, making them ideal for planting in hanging
                baskets. Fuchsias come in a variety of shades of red and pink, and can be either bushy or
                viny.
            </p>
            <h2>Caring for Fuchsias</h2>
            <p>
                Fuchsias naturally perform best in mild climates, but can alternatively be treated as a
                plant for cool seasons. They don't need very much sun, but should get about four hours
                daily, being kept in mostly shaded areas. Watering should be done daily for moist, but
                not oversaturated, soil. Fuchsias should be stored indoors in winter and watered once a
                month during this period.
            </p>
            <h2>Planting Fuchsias</h2>
            <p>
                Fuchsias should be planted in the spring, when night temperatures are consistently above
                forty degrees. They perfer somewhat moist soil, but their pots should allow most water to
                drain out. In hotter climates, plant fuchsias in areas with speckled shade and fertilize
                about every two weeks.
