            <h2>About Chrysanthemums</h2>
            <p>
                Popular fall flowers, mums come in a wide variety of colors with a large quantity of
                small, but showy, florets. They can grow to a width and height of up to three feet,
                if cared for properly. Blooming happens when the length of day is less than twelve
                hours, so expect flowers to start showing during the fall.
            </p>
            <h2>Caring for Chrysanthemums</h2>
            <p>
                Mums should be kept in well-drained soil, as standing water can quickly cause problems
                for them. Mums do best in full sun and should get plenty of compost and rich soil.
                If your mums aren't blooming, try providing them with more water, keeping them away from
                unnatural light sources, or moving them into a spot where they will recieve more sun.
            </p>
            <h2>Planting Mums</h2>
            <p>
                It's best to plant mums in early spring- if planting from seeds, start indoors, about
                two months before spring frost season ends. Plant mums two to three feet apart from
                eachother, at the same depth they were potted in. Planting mums too deep can result in
                too much water, which can rot their stems. Be sure to water mums plenty, but also make
                sure the water can drain out so their soil remains moist, but not too wet.
