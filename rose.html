            <h2>About Roses</h2>
            <p>
                Rose shrubs are a popular choice for gardens, and the flowers are perfect for boquets and
                gifts. Roses have been cultivated for thousands of years for their hardiness and beauty,
                resulting in an expansive variety of types and colors. Interestingly, rose petals are
                edible- just be careful to not consume any pesticides.
            </p>
            <h2>Caring for Roses</h2>
            <p>
                Rose bushes require plenty of watering- at least twice weekly. Make sure the soil has good
                drainage though, and ensure the entire root zone is saturated. Plucking wilted flowers from
                rose bushes can promote more flowering and should be done at least once a week, but should
                be avoided at least a month before the first frost.
            </p>
            <h2>Planting Roses</h2>
            <p>
                When planting roses, wear thick gloves to protect yourself from the thorny stems. Dig a hole
                over a foot wide, and loosen the roots before planting. Once the rose bush is rooted, water
                it thoroughly. Do not overcrowd rose bushes; try to keep them at least a couple feet apart.
