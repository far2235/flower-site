            <h2>About Asters</h2>
            <p>
                Asters can grow from one to six feet tall and typically bloom in the late
                summer through fall. Their starry flowers come in shades of purple and blue,
                and are great for attracting butterflies to your garden.
            </p>
            <h2>Caring for Asters</h2>
            <p>
                Asters grow best in areas with cool summers and under partail sun. For hotter
                regions, it's best to keep asters out of the sun during the midday. Asters perfer
                moist (but not oversaturated!) soil, with no sand or clay.
            </p>
            <h2>Planting Asters</h2>
            <p>
                Once the temperature begins to warm up and there are no signs of frost, young asters
                should be okay to plant. This usually means mid to late spring, but can vary depending
                on your region. Fully grown asters can usually be purchased in late summer to early
                fall, and can be planted safely during this time. If planting aster seeds, plant them
                outside during the fall, or indoors in winter. Asters should be planted about three
                feet apart from one another and require regular watering to keep their soil cool.
